[N-Triples](http://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/) intake to elastic search


## Inspiration 

N-Triples is a text base, widely-supported protocol to exchange knowledge graphs. The library defines schema and rules to store knowledge graphs into Elastic Search.    


## Getting started

The latest version of the library is available at its master branch. All development, including new features and bug fixes, take place on the master branch using forking and pull requests as described in contribution guidelines.

To use and develop the library you need:
* Erlang/OTP 18.x or later
* rebar3
* Elastic Search

### Installation

If you use `rebar` you can include the library in your project with
```
{elasticnt, ".*",
   {git, "https://github.com/fogfish/elasticnt", {branch, master}}
}
```

### Running 

The library requires Elastic Search cluster, the docker container is easiest way to run standalone instance of the cluster for development purposes.  
```
docker run -it -p 9200:9200 fogfish/elasticsearch
```

Build library and run the development console
```
make
make run
```

Let's create an index and store the N-triple
```erlang
%%
%% start application
elasticnt:start().

%%
%% open cluster connection, define implicit index identity
{ok, Sock} = esio:socket("http://192.168.99.100:9200/nt").

%%
%% deploy index schema
elasticnt:schema(Sock, []).

%%
%% store N-triple to index
elasticnt:put(Sock, 
   #{
      s => <<"http://example.org">>,
      p => <<"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title">>,
      o => <<"Example Domain">>
   }
).
```

You can inspect created index and data using Elastic Search REST API .
```
curl 'http://192.168.99.100:9200/_search?q=Example&pretty'
```

* study [native interface](src/elasticnt.erl)
* understand the design consideration of index [schema](src/schema.md)
* check [tips and hints](doc/howto.md)

## How to Contribute

`elasticnt` is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests.

### getting started

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Read the README.md for build instructions
* Make pull request

### commit message

The commit message helps us to write a good release note, speed-up review process. The message should address two question what changed and why. The project follows the template defined by chapter [Contributing to a Project](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html) of Git book.

>
> Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes
>
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the two together.
> 
> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
> 
> Bullet points are okay, too
> 
> Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
